# ST239 Statistical Learning Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for the **ST239 Statistical Learning** assignment.  
The assignment is worth 100% of the module mark and is divided into four main questions, each focusing on different aspects of statistical learning and data science.

## Assignment Overview

### **Question 1 â€“ Dimensionality Reduction of Feature Space**

- Dataset: `penguins.pkl` (344 penguins, 7 variables).
- Techniques applied:
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â†’ unsupervised, finds directions of maximum variance.
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** â†’ supervised, finds directions that best separate classes.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (ST239 only) â†’ classification with separating hyperplanes.
- Deliverables:
  - Visualisations of reduced feature space.
  - Explanation of variance captured by components.
  - Comparison of PCA vs LDA vs SVM results.

ðŸ‘‰ Tests ability to **reduce feature space, visualise results, and interpret differences** between methods.

### **Question 2 â€“ A Comparison of Clustering Techniques**

**Part (a): Computational Analysis**

- Datasets: 5 `.csv` files with different clustering structures.
- Techniques applied:
  - **Hierarchical clustering** (single, complete, average, medoid linkage).
  - **K-means clustering** (with optimal `k` selection).
  - **DBSCAN** (density-based clustering).
- Requirements:
  - Visualisations: dendrograms, cluster assignment plots.
  - Evaluation against true labels.
  - Discussion of strengths/weaknesses of each method.

**Part (b): Manual Hierarchical Clustering**

- Apply hierarchical clustering with **complete linkage** using **single matching distance** on a categorical dataset of animals.
- Draw dendrogram, explain algorithm, and interpret results.

ðŸ‘‰ Tests understanding of **unsupervised learning methods**, both computational and conceptual.

### **Question 4 â€“ Extended Data Analysis on Online Shopping Dataset**

- Dataset: `OnlineShopping.csv` (user sessions with categorical & numerical features, target = `Revenue`).
- Workflow:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: summary statistics, visualisations.
  - **Preprocessing**: one-hot encoding, scaling, feature engineering.
  - **Model building**:
    - At least **1 probabilistic method** (e.g. logistic regression, Naive Bayes).
    - At least **2 other methods** (e.g. decision trees, random forest, SVM, k-NN).
  - **Evaluation**: accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.
  - **Interpretation**:
    - Expert-level: technical findings, metrics, variable significance.
    - Non-expert: plain English summary for decision-makers.
  - **Report writing**: conclusions, limitations, potential extensions.

ðŸ‘‰ Tests ability to deliver a **full applied data science pipeline**: preprocessing â†’ modelling â†’ evaluation â†’ reporting.
